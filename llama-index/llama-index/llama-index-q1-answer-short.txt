In LlamaIndex, each index (e.g. VectorStoreIndex) provides a method to build from nodes. Internally, VectorStoreIndex.build_index_from_nodes() will filter out any nodes with no content and then call its helper _build_index_from_nodes() to actually insert the nodes​. The _build_index_from_nodes method batches the nodes and adds them to the index’s data structures (the vector store and index_struct). This is an override of the base index method, optimized so that if the vector store keeps text, it can avoid storing duplicate text in the docstore​.
