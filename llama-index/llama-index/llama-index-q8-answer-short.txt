Every Node in LlamaIndex can carry metadata (as a dictionary of fields). This metadata is stored in the index’s docstore and can be used at query time. LlamaIndex provides a MetadataFilters mechanism: you can specify filters (e.g., { "author": "Alice"}) and the retriever will only return nodes whose metadata match. In the VectorIndexRetriever, for example, there is a filters parameter in its constructor​. If filters are set, the retriever applies them when constructing the query or post-filters the results from the vector store. Additionally, the index keeps mappings of document IDs to node IDs (RefDocInfo) so it knows which nodes came from which source document​. This helps when returning results – if a vector store returns only IDs, the retriever can fetch the full Node (with text + metadata) from the docstore by mapping the ID to the node object. In summary, metadata is preserved with each node, stored in the docstore, and usable for filtering and for reference in responses.
