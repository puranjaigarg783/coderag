LlamaIndex Embedding Model Definition and Usage
Based on the provided code chunks, LlamaIndex defines and manages embedding models through several key components:

Embedding Model Definition
LlamaIndex defines which embedding model to use for text in two primary locations:

Settings Class (settings.py):

The Settings class maintains a global embedding model configuration
It provides getter and setter methods for the embed_model property
If no model is explicitly set, it defaults to calling resolve_embed_model("default")
Embedding Resolution (embeddings/utils.py):

The resolve_embed_model function is the central factory method that converts various inputs into concrete embedding implementations
This function handles multiple input types and returns a BaseEmbedding instance
Default Model Selection
When no specific model is provided, LlamaIndex's behavior is:

In testing environments (IS_TESTING env var), it uses MockEmbedding
Otherwise, it attempts to use OpenAIEmbedding from the llama_index.embeddings.openai module
If OpenAI is unavailable, it suggests alternatives like embed_model='local'
Model Type Resolution
The resolve_embed_model function handles multiple embedding sources:

String identifiers:

"default": Uses OpenAI embeddings (with fallback to MockEmbedding for testing)
"clip:...": Uses CLIP-based embeddings for images (e.g., "clip:ViT-B/32")
"local:...": Uses Hugging Face embeddings (e.g., "local:sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2")
LangChain compatibility: Adapts LangChain embedding models through LangchainEmbedding

Fallback behavior: Uses MockEmbedding if embeddings are explicitly disabled (None)

Embedding Usage
The BaseEmbedding abstract class defines the interface for all embedding models with these key methods:

_get_text_embedding(self, text: str) -> Embedding: Abstract method that derived classes must implement to embed documents

_get_query_embedding(self, query: str) -> Embedding: Abstract method for embedding queries

get_text_embedding(self, text: str) -> Embedding: Public method that may add special instructions to the raw text before embedding

All concrete embedding implementations inherit from BaseEmbedding and provide specific implementations of these methods, ensuring a consistent interface throughout the system.
