LlamaIndex provides Reader classes (connectors) for many data sources. For local files, the SimpleDirectoryReader is a basic connector that reads all files in a folder. Its load_data() method opens each file and wraps the text into a Document object​. There are more specialized readers available (many through the LlamaHub library) for sources like Notion, Slack, Wikipedia, etc. Each of these readers returns documents/nodes that LlamaIndex can ingest. For instance, BeautifulSoupWebReader can fetch and parse HTML from a URL into Document nodes, and a NotionPageReader can pull pages from Notion. All such connectors ultimately produce Document objects (with text and metadata) that you then pass to an index (e.g., via index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs)). Thus, the “data connector” stage is separate from indexing – it’s about converting external data into a standard format for LlamaIndex. (In code, using a LlamaHub loader might look like: loader = download_loader("NotionPageReader")(...); docs = loader.load_data(); index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs) – demonstrating the pattern of load then index.)
