The xv6 operating system handles process creation and management through the fork() system call in proc.c. The fork() function creates a new process by duplicating the parent process, with its own process control block, memory space, and file descriptors. The child process starts execution at the same point as the parent but with a return value of 0, while the parent receives the child's PID. This mechanism allows for efficient process creation and is fundamental to the Unix process model.
